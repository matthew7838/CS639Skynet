## UCS Satellite Database

## Overview

The UCS Satellite Database is the premier free and openly accessible database cataloging all of the over 5,000 actively operating satellites. It provides a detailed record of 28 different aspects of each satellite, from its launch details, orbit position, to its functionality. The database is a fundamental tool for space professionals, researchers, journalists, and satellite enthusiasts. As the pace of satellite launches is surging rapidly with organizations like SpaceX and One Web planning satellite constellations numbering in tens of thousands, there's an increasing need to automate the data collection and verification process. We aim to integrate automation in data collection and also explore innovative ways to present data using images and tables for users who may not be technically inclined.
